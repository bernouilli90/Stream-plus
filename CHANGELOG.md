## [0.2.14] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- **Complete Stream Testing Failure Behavior**: All stream statistics are now cleared whenever ANY part of stream testing fails
  - **ffprobe failures**: When ffprobe command fails or returns invalid data, all stats are cleared
  - **ffmpeg failures**: When ffmpeg fails to calculate bitrate, all stats are cleared (previous change)
  - **Timeouts**: When stream testing times out, all stats are cleared
  - **General errors**: When any exception occurs during testing, all stats are cleared
  - **Consistent behavior**: Stream testing now requires complete success of both ffprobe and ffmpeg for stats to be saved

## [0.2.13] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- **Stream Testing Failure Behavior**: When ffmpeg fails to calculate bitrate, all stream statistics are now cleared instead of keeping partial ffprobe data
  - Previously: ffprobe data was saved even when bitrate calculation failed
  - Now: Complete failure when bitrate cannot be calculated, clearing all stats from Dispatcharr

## [0.2.12] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- **Stream Testing**: Removed alternative ffprobe command fallback, now uses only the primary ffprobe command for stream analysis

### Fixed
- **Stream Testing UnboundLocalError**: Fixed critical bug where `test_stream()` method crashed with "UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'quoted_cmd' where it is not associated with a value"
  - Issue occurred when stream testing failed early due to undefined variable reference in logging code
  - Properly structured command logging with correct variable definitions and scope
  - Fixed indentation and code structure issues from recent logging enhancements
  - Stream testing now handles all error conditions without crashing

### Fixed
- **Stream Stats Clearing on Test Failures**: Fixed critical issue where `clear_stream_stats()` method wasn't properly clearing stream statistics due to Dispatcharr API limitations with PATCH operations
  - Changed implementation from PATCH with partial updates to PUT with complete stream object retrieval and update
  - Method now retrieves current stream, clears `stream_stats` field, removes `stream_stats_updated_at` timestamp, and updates complete stream object
  - Ensures failed stream tests properly remove stale statistics that could affect rule evaluation
  - Added comprehensive unit tests covering success cases, error handling, and edge cases
  - Created integration test script for validation against real Dispatcharr instances

### Technical Details
- Modified `clear_stream_stats()` in `api/dispatcharr_client.py` to use PUT instead of PATCH

  - Enables future enhancements for score analysis and debugging

### Fixed
- **Stream Testing Logic**: Fixed critical issue where streams with existing stats were not re-tested
  - When `test_streams_before_sorting=True`, streams are now properly tested based on timestamp
  - Implemented proper timestamp checking using `stream_stats_updated_at` field
  - Streams with stats older than `retest_days_threshold` are re-tested automatically
  - **Stream stats are now properly updated** when testing succeeds or cleared when testing fails
  - Fixed issue where stale stats prevented proper rule evaluation
  - Improved reliability of auto-assignment rules with stream testing enabled
- **FFprobe Path Configuration**: Fixed Windows compatibility issue with ffprobe executable path

  - Resolves "ffprobe executable not found" error on Windows systems
- **Stream Stats Clearing on Test Failures**: Fixed issue where failed stream tests didn't clear stale statistics
  - Modified `clear_stream_stats()` to only update `stream_stats` field, avoiding API issues with timestamp
  - Removed problematic `stream_stats_updated_at: None` that could cause API rejection
  - Added explicit logging to show when stats are cleared or clearing fails
  - Ensures failed streams have their invalid stats properly removed from Dispatcharr

### Enhanced
- **FFprobe Stream Selection**: Primary ffprobe command now focuses on first video stream
  - Added `-select_streams v:0` to VLC-style ffprobe command for better compatibility
  - Improves stream analysis success rate for complex multi-stream sources
  - Maintains JSON output format for consistent data parsing
- **Stream Testing Performance Optimization**: Reordered ffprobe and ffmpeg execution for faster failure detection
  - FFprobe now runs first as a quick accessibility check (faster than ffmpeg)
  - If ffprobe fails, ffmpeg is skipped entirely and test is marked as failed immediately
  - Reduces testing time for broken streams by avoiding unnecessary ffmpeg execution
  - Maintains full functionality when both tools succeed

## [0.2.7] - 2025-10-18

  - Removes hardcoded VLC user-agent from alternative command
  - Improves stream testing reliability for user-agent sensitive streams

  - Force Include: Streams added to channel regardless of rule conditions
  - Force Exclude: Streams excluded from channel even if they match all conditions
  - UI components: Search and select streams with visual badges in rule cards and modals
  - Logic improvements: Forced includes/excludes applied during both testing and evaluation phases

### Fixed
